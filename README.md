## RC4 Encryption

The Rivest Cypher 4 is a stream cipher algorithm developed in the 1980s, remarkable for its fast implementations in both hardware and software.The RC4 algorithm outputs a pseudo random stream of bytes based on a n-byte long key. The key can be any length, but is usually longer than 6 bytes. The bitstream is deterministic, as a key will always produce the same bitstream. 

The counter design (gdsii file) is located at [here](https://github.com/AyaseErii/gf180-demo-sequential_counter/tree/main/openlane/cntr_example/runs/wrapped_rc4/results/final/gds) and the wrappered counter (gdsii file) is located at [here](https://github.com/AyaseErii/gf180-demo-sequential_counter/tree/main/openlane/user_project_wrapper/runs/user_project_wrapper/results/final/gds).
